# DoubleLinkedList-Binary-Search-Tree

•	Created my own custom double LinkedList class.
•	Created abstract class that the Node class inherit from.
•	Used interface class that the double LinkedList and Binary Search tree  classes implements from. 
•	In my linked list there are rightLink, leftLink, and a root. and  you can remove, add any object within alphabetic order.
•	In BinarySearch Tree I used recursion in traverse().
•	In double LinkedList and BinarySearch tree classes the following actions are available:
1.add- 2.remove- 3.traverse any Object(String, integer etc.)
